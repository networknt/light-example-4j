# This handler is generic request handler for the OAuth 2.0 provider authorization code redirect.
# It receives the auth code and goes to the OAuth 2.0 provider to get the subject token. The jwt
# token is then sent to the browser with two cookies with splitting header/payload and signature.
# Another options is to keep the jwt in session and return sessionId to the browser. In either
# case, the csrf token will be send with a separate cookie.
